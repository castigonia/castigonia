I'm a Python developer based in Austin, TX, with a background in backend engineering, data automation, and full-stack deployment. I'm now expanding my focus into IT infrastructure, networking, and DevOps engineering. I enjoy working with systems that scale, code that lasts, and networks that *just work*.
